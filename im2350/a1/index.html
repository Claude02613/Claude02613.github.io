            <li>What was the first thing you paid attention to when interacting with the experience?</li>
               <div style="font-size: 5px;" id= "answer">
            As this website chose to set the full window as the size to display the project,
            the authors want draw our attention to this big space they left, which is a HDRI image but have a fisheye lens effect
             on it, furthermore, using this effect generate an one point perspective that can make the scene more immersive.
            So, the first thing I paid attention to is the scene itself, which is the fisheye HDRI image.
               </div>
            <li> Spend two minutes with the experience and create a list of each of your discrete actions.</li>
                <div style="font-size: 5px;" id= "answer">
                    <ul>
                        <li>1.drag the cursor accidently</li>
                        <li>2.found the interactives between the cursor and the project</li>
                        <li>3.unmuted the project and noticed that the tones and keys of the 
                            project is changing based on cursor's motion.
                        </li>
                        <li>3.keep moving the mouse and try to figure out how they actually interacting, 
                            like: 
                            a.if the 'liquid flows' or 'liquid ripples'follow the direction of 
                                     mouse moving?
                            b.if the image behind the scene is changing or not.
                            c.the lumming is changing in the scene as the flows' shape are changing 
                            instantly, is the light setting in the scene changing instantly as well?
                            d.what is the connection or regime between the sound changing and cursor's motion, is
                            it based on the motion's directions or it's based on the current location of the cursor.
                        </li>
                        <li>4.start focus on the 'workplace' at the top-right side of the screen where 
                            have a lots of bars and figures for audiences to paly around with. 
                        </li>
                        <li>5.start adjusting different figures on the table</li>

                    </ul>
                </div>
            <li>What part of the experience did you spend the most time engaging with?</li>
            <div style="font-size: 5px;" id= "answer">
                    I reckon that I spend the most of the time on adjusting the different figures and elements on the 
                    table, as they have <span color="red"><b>9</b></span> different features that not only take control of the 
                    visual interactives but also audio effects. And it is sort of difficult for some people who don't have 
                    experience with physics as they using terms like "entropy", adn "lowpass". So I think it is the part where people 
                    would spend most time on.

            </div>
            <li>What was the most common action in your two minute interaction with the experience?</li>
            <div style="font-size:5px;" id="answer">
                   Using mouse to interactive with the liquid and the workspace, most of the motion is moving cursor and click.
            </div>
            <li>What is your impression of the intended primary goal of the interactive experience?</li>
            <div style="font-size:5px;" id="answer">
                As this is kind of conceptual and experimental project, I reckon the primary goal of this interactive 
                experience is to find a way that connect the experimental audio effects with the physical interactives. In other 
                word, they try to find a aesthetic way to visualize the processing of experimental audio effects.
                Additionally, they could expand the experiences across different divices from mobile divices to computers by this web based project.
 
            </div>
            <li>How does the interactive experience communicate this primary goal?</li>
            <div style="font-size:5px;" id="answer">
                By using the Liquid effects to illustrates the changing of sounds. they using visual effects and the adjustable features to help people get 
                a better understand of the interactives between sonic part and visual part.
            </div>
            <li>What is your impression of how the experience should be interacted with over time? (For how long and how many different times)</li>
            <div style="font-size:5px;" id="answer">
                From my perspective, the interacting experience should be less interesting as before. Because even the project 
                has an interactive interface and have several features that can adjust to change the ripples' shape or volume. There is still
                limitaitons here, after playing sround a few times, I think I am not that excited and motivated to interact with it. 
                So I think my impression of the website is kind of nagative.
            </div>
            <li>How does the interactive experience communicate how it should be interacted with over time?</li>
            <div style="font-size:5px;" id="answer">
                I think is play with the workspace they offer, which you can find 9 elements to play with the visual effects feedback. In my opinion, I think they want users 
                focus on the visual effects changing and sounds effects by adjusting the differnet figures reapeatly. As the visaul effects feedback screen 
                takes the marjority of the windows, and the workplace set at the top-right side as a sidebar.

              <li>What other media forms (digital or otherwise) does the experience reference?</li>
              <div style="font-size:5px;" id="answer">
               I think it is refere to the mixing desk or music console where you can easily find this "workspace" with a lots of bars or 
               knobs to adjust the tones, volume and effects like distorted or overdrive. BUt it also can say is more like Touch Desginer form 
               project, but more simple and straightforward, only provide the experiences of controlling visual effects and SFX at the same time.
            </div>
              <li>What does this reference/s communicate to you about how you should act when engaging with your research experience?</li>
              <div style="font-size:5px;" id="answer">
               As the work place is like audio mixers that I mentioned before, they are trying to tell people play with the different features on the desk 
               and find your favorite setting. Similarly, Tuner spend most of the time adjusting the features to achive the perfect tune, just like audiences interacting with this project.
            
            </div>
              <li>What does this reference/s communicate to you about how you should feel when engaging with your research experience?</li>
              <div style="font-size:5px;" id="answer">
              I think this references offers me the focus of the audio, whcih could draw my attentions into the connections between the sonic and visual. So it offers not 
              just a single feeling but it is like, guiding you to find the thing that they want you to experence.
            </div>
              <li>What is the most frustrating part of the interaction to you and what makes that part frustrating?</li>
              <div style="font-size:5px;" id="answer">
              I would like to say it is the limitation of the scenes' background images and the limitaitons of the controller. Like I mentioned before,
              the after several times experience this project, I felt I have already tried all of the features, Sadly, they don't have many options like 
              increase the gain of the sounds or mroe effects of the sounds, even for visual effect part there is only changing the lightness instead of changing the colors or positions of the lighting.

             </div>
              <li>What is the most satisfying part of the interaction to you and what makes that part satisfying?</li>
              <div style="font-size:5px;" id="answer"> I reckon it is the processing of the ripples and waves in the scene and just immerging into the scene as the slow motion do create a sensation of satisfying
            , this visual effects really makes audiences engaged with the project. Additionally, I personally like electornical music, so I also found interesting when I playing around with the controllers, 
            which is another satisfying thing that I experienced from this project.
